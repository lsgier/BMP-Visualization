# Druid

Get the latest version of Druid: https://druid.apache.org/downloads.html. The small single server configuration is the lowest pre-installed deployment configuration that was successfully tested. This requires at least 64 GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores.

Use the *post-index-task* service to load the Kafka streams (route_monitor.json) as described [here](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-batch.html).
